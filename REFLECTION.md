The most challenging part of this project was definitely getting comfortable with TypeScript. I really wanted to make sure everything functioned correctly, but I struggled at first with routing, hooks, and getting the local storage to work. I spent a ton of time researching—reading, Googling, and watching videos—just to make it all click. I feel much better about useState and useEffect now, but other parts are still a little foggy. On top of the code, I had a nightmare scenario during deployment. I was using Copilot to help me get the app onto GH Pages, and somehow it ended up losing all my files before I could commit my final refinements. Luckily, I had another folder where I’d been testing things out, so I was able to recover my work. Even though the project seemed simple during the planning phase, it took way longer than I expected because it felt like I was forgetting the lessons as soon as I started coding. In the end, though, seeing everything finally come together was a huge relief.

For the design, I made the deliberate choice to stick with custom CSS instead of using Tailwind. My favorite part of any project is the styling, and I’m currently building my brand as an artist around a specific "Mac System-1" aesthetic. I’ve tried Tailwind before, but I always ran into issues where it would override my styles when I wanted more control. Since I wanted this app to look exactly a certain way, custom CSS was the best route for me. It allowed me to have total control over the retro look without fighting a framework. I’m definitely interested in checking out Material UI (MUI) down the road, but for this project, staying "hands-on" with my CSS was the right move for my brand.
